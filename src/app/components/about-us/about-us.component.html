This team organizes initiatives such as Women’s Day celebrations and Maytarno Medavo, a heartfelt program dedicated to honoring senior members of the community. Asmita continues to expand its efforts with new initiatives aimed at fostering inclusion, support, and personal growth for women and elders alike.</p>
    <p><b>Ameya</b> – A vibrant and energetic team dedicated to youth between the ages of 18 to 30. Ameya conducts various developmental, cultural, and community-driven activities designed to inspire leadership, self-growth, and social responsibility among young adults.</p>

Through engaging programs and interactive experiences, the team helps instill pride in heritage and encourages the next generation to stay rooted in tradition while growing with confidence.</p>
    <p>A major highlight of 2025 was Sanskruti Utsav, a grand cultural program jointly organized by Asmita, Ameya, and Sanskar Dham. The event featured over 200 children performing on a large stage, presenting vibrant and meaningful acts based on religious themes.
